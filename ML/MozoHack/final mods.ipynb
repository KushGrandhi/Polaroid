different effects of force as we discussed the simple definition of forces forces a ph or a pull a more fancy definition of forces forces a physical quantity that changces or tends to change the state

we can see the forces f newton so it as a value and the unit is newton and as we saw when we apply a force we can change the state of rest of this ball or i can change the state of motion so when the ball is moving i stop the ball or when we apply a ce we can change the dimensions of this ball so we can change the shape let's sp the different effects of force and this new definition of force on our concept board now what you think happens when multiple forces act on the body as we saw a single force can make the body move so when i pu this toy but now if i apply two forces one with this string and one with this white string now the two forces if there are equal in opposite as you can see the toy does not move because these two forces are canceing each other these are called balanced forces and the net force here is zero now if i pull the toy like this with the two strings in the same direction so can you see that multiple forces are acting on the toy one with the red string and one with the white string and these forces they don 't cancel each other they re called unbalanced forces because the net force here was not zero and the unbalanced forces is needed to set a stationary object into motion or as we saw it can be used to stop up moving object or change the speed of a moving body or change the direction of a moving body balanced forces can change the shape of a body for example if i squeeze this ball the balanced forces here are acting from this part of my hand so these fingers and this part of my hand so the two forces cancel each other the ball is not going any where but it' shape it's dimension is changing other example is using a spring so when i compress the spring i 'm applying an equal and opposite force on either s and as you can see these two balanced forces are compressing the spring there changeing the shape of the spring and now when i stretchs the spring these two balanced forces are increasing the length of thespring we know that unbalanced force is needed to start the motion of a body for example when i apply a force on this ball i set it into motion now what happens when the forces removed will the ball continue in its state of motion forver let 's see this table is very very long so will the ball keep on moving forver we know from our experience that 's not true the ball will finally go in stop at a point and white does the ball stop that's right it 's due to friction there's a frictional force acting on the ball all the time opposing the motion of the ball and it is this unbalanced force that stops the ball but let 's see this table was friction less then what will happen this ball will continue in motion for ver because there's no unbalanced force to stop the moion of the ball now what are some other examples where friction stops the motion when you kick a football on a field the football finally stops due to the friction of the grass on the ball or let 's say car is going on a road and the driver is not pressing the accelerator or break when the car is in motion but the car will finally stop even without the braks it's due to the friction of the road on the reeels or let ' see your peddling a bicycle and you stop pedling the bicycle finally stops due to friction so it is this unbalanced force that stops the motion of these bodyies as we saw when one force or more than one for acts on the body and

motion means the bodyies moving with theconstant velocity and this happens when their balance forces the net or result in force is zero now if you think about un balance forces the net force is not zero so the bodyies in a state of non uniform motion here the velocity of the body is increasing or decreasing this means the body is under acceleration or rearation when un balance forces are applied on the body because the net force is not zero do you know how forces measured remember forces of vector quantity so it has b magnitude and direction the sa unit use to measure magnitude is newton they noted by capital and a what instrument is used to measure the magnitde of for force let me give you a hint rate is a type of force right is a force do you to ear bll on an object and the direction waight is always downwards but what instrument is used to measure weight that's right it's a spring balance and let me show you a spring balance here and as you can see it is used to measure the rate of this ball the reading is to newton as we saw we can use a spring balance to measure the right of a body but now how can we use the spring balance to measure force let me show you let's say we place the ball like this connected to the spring balance what will be the reading of the spring balance here that's right it 's going to be zero because the entire right of the ball is acting on the table and the spring is not being pulled now let's say i want to measure the force with which i pull the ball but rather than pulling it from the strpring here i going to pull it using the spring balance so when i pull the ball like this the reading on the spring balance will give me the force with which i pulling the ball and you can try this your self take the spring balance and try to pull a heavy object like a chair with the spring balance then when you look at the reading on thespring balance why you re pulling the chair that's the value of the force so the spring balance will help you measure the force with which you pulling the chair as we discussed forces measured in the unit newton newton is the ssi unit of force now to understand the unit newton we need to look at the formula for force we know from our experience that a small force causes a small increase in speed but a large force causes a creater increasing speed this more acceleration here and this is exactly what newutton second law of motion states that the rate of change of linear momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and it takes pace in the direction of the force let's analyze newton second law and derite the formula for force now you know what is momentum momentum is mass into velocity so pe quence m into the fa p the symbo of momentum for this ball the momentum is going to be the mass ofthe ball multiplied by the velocity of the ball when we say linear momentum we mean the body is traveing in a straight line like here and change of linear momentum means final momentum minus the initial momentum final momentum will be m to v where these the final velocity and the initial momentum will be and into you where use the initial velocity so change of linear momentum is n v minus m you and what will be the rate of change of linear momentum that's right m v minus m you by team for rate we need to divide by time here tis the time and according to the second law it states that the full suppli on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of linear momentum of the body so f is directly proportional to m v minus same you by t n you take m common we have v minus you by t and what is v minus you by t that's right acceleration so f the force is directly proportional to mass into acceleration now if you want to change this directly proportional relation into an equation we need to use a constant of proportionality so we have f equal to ke into m me case the constant of proportionality here and based on the units the scientists set it to be one so the equation becomes f equal to m a the force on a body so the force applied on a body is the mass of the body into the acceleration of the body and that 's a formula for force f equal to and how can we define one newton based on the formula f equally to m a it 's really easy if you look at the formula f equal to m a so one newton is the force that needs to be applied on the body of mass one kg to give it an acceleration of one me of a second square so one newton equals one kg into one me ter a second square\", \"high friends in the last chapter we learnt all about motion and the different physics ters like distance displacement speed and veloity but what causes motion for example if i take this ball what do i need to do to give motion to the ball that's right i need to give it a push so i need to apply a force on the ball to give it motion and what is need ed to stop the motion of the ball again a force similarly if you consider the motion of car 's the engine that applies the force on the cart causing it to move and the braks apply a force to stop the car and forces going to be the topic of this video we 're going to learn all about force the different types of force and the effects of force i'm going to make the contcepts really easy for you and after you watch this video to try solving the quizs and the top three questions on this topic links are given below the video 'm sure you know what forces but in physics how can we define force there's a very simple definition in physics forces defined as a push or a pull for example to move this ball i need to give it a push so the force here is a push and when the ball is moving i need to apply a push to stop the ableall and to move the story i need to pull it so here the forces of pull on the toy as we discussed in physics forces defined as a push or a bll now let me ask you is forces scal quantity or a vector quantity that's right forces a vector quantity remember scaler quantities only have magnitude they only have a value but no direction vector quantities have both magnitude and direction and if you think about force it make sense because when the apply force there's a magnitude as well as a direction or for example when i pull this storyy let's see with the one new ton force one newutton is the magnitude and the direction represented by the ar o here is along the string forces can be divided into two types force set contact and force set a distance enforce it contact there is a real contact when the forces applyed for example when i push this ball can you see that there's a real contact between my hand and the ball or when i pull this story with the string there's a contact with my hand and the string so inenforce of contact there's a real contact but enfor it a distance contact is not necessary for example if i lift this ball and i drop it how does the ball f that's right do you to the gravitational force on the ball and gravitation force acset a distance there is no real contact here now is magnetic force for it a distance that's right magnetic force is for at a distance as you can see here when i bring the magnet near the pin it can attract the pin from a distance so contact is not necessary and just like gravitational force magnetic force is also for at a distance another example of force it a distance is electrostatic force the force between chargesces we know that like charges they repel each other and unlike charges attract each other but contact is not necessary its for set a distance for example the pull between protons and electrons in an atom is electrostatic force force set a distance so we look at two types of forces force set contact and for set a distance exampleples of for set contact was when i push the ball so there's a contact or i pull this toy or when a box cer punches is openant that's force at contact and what are the examplees of force set a distance gravitational force the force between the earth and the ball or the magnetic force when the magnet forlls the spin and as we discussed electrostatic force these our forces at a distance where contact is not necessary let's place the definition of force and two types of forces force set contact and force at a distance on our contcept ball what are the effects of force force has many different effects so we are going to diide it into five points let's start with the first one force can set a stage tory object into motion for example this ballest stationary and if i apply a force i can set it into motion the second effect of forces it can stop a moving object for example if this ball is in motion i apply a force and i can stop it the third effect of forces it can change the speed of a moving body for example if this ballis moving with the slow speed and i hit it i can increase the speed of the ball the for effect of forces it can change the direction of a moving body for example of the ball is moving like this and apply a force i can change thedirection of the ball or if you pid cricket or baseball you know that when you hit theball you can change the speed and the direction of the ball the fifth effect of forces it can change the timeimensions of a body for example if i squeeze the soft ball i can change its shape or if i take the spring here and if i compress it you can see i can change the shape of the spring or if i stretch it the shape changces so these are the five different effects of force as we discussed the simple definition of forces forces a ph or a pull a more fancy definition of forces forces a physical quantity that changces or tends to change the state of rest or motion of a body or changes the timeimensions of a body now let 's understand this definition what does physical quantity mean physical quantity something that can be measured for example we can see the forces f newton so it as a value and the unit is newton and as we saw when we apply a force we can change the state of rest of this ball or i can change the state of motion so when the ball is moving i stop the ball or when we apply a ce we can change the dimensions of this ball so we can change the shape let's sp the different effects of force and this new definition of force on our concept board now what you think happens when multiple forces act on the body as we saw a single force can make the body move so when i pu this toy but now if i apply two forces one with this string and one with this white string now the two forces if there are equal in opposite as you can see the toy does not move because these two forces are canceing each other these are called balanced forces and the net force here is zero now if i pull the toy like this with the two strings in the same direction so can you see that multiple forces are acting on the toy one with the red string and one with the white string and these forces they don 't cancel each other they re called unbalanced forces because the net force here was not zero and the unbalanced forces is needed to set a stationary object into motion or as we saw it can be used to stop up moving object or change the speed of a moving body or change the direction of a moving body balanced forces can change the shape of a body for example if i squeeze this ball the balanced forces here are acting from this part of my hand so these fingers and this part of my hand so the two forces cancel each other the ball is not going any where but it' shape it's dimension is changing other example is using a spring so when i compress the spring i 'm applying an equal and opposite force on either s and as you can see these two balanced forces are compressing the spring there changeing the shape of the spring and now when i stretchs the spring these two balanced forces are increasing the length of thespring we know that unbalanced force is needed to start the motion of a body for example when i apply a force on this ball i set it into motion now what happens when the forces removed will the ball continue in its state of motion forver let 's see this table is very very long so will the ball keep on moving forver we know from our experience that 's not true the ball will finally go in stop at a point and white does the ball stop that's right it 's due to friction there's a frictional force acting on the ball all the time opposing the motion of the ball and it is this unbalanced force that stops the ball but let 's see this table was friction less then what will happen this ball will continue in motion for ver because there's no unbalanced force to stop the moion of the ball now what are some other examples where friction stops the motion when you kick a football on a field the football finally stops due to the friction of the grass on the ball or let 's say car is going on a road and the driver is not pressing the accelerator or break when the car is in motion but the car will finally stop even without the braks it's due to the friction of the road on the reeels or let ' see your peddling a bicycle and you stop pedling the bicycle finally stops due to friction so it is this unbalanced force that stops the motion of these bodyies as we saw when one force or more than one for acts on the body and we analyze the forces then we can see the forces on the body are balanced forces or there unbalanced forces now the case of balanced forces the net force is zero so the bodyies in a state of rest or its's in uniform motion unifor motion means the bodyies moving with theconstant velocity and this happens when their balance forces the net or result in force is zero now if you think about un balance forces the net force is not zero so the bodyies in a state of non uniform motion here the velocity of the body is increasing or decreasing this means the body is under acceleration or rearation when un balance forces are applied on the body because the net force is not zero do you know how forces measured remember forces of vector quantity so it has b magnitude and direction the sa unit use to measure magnitude is newton they noted by capital and a what instrument is used to measure the magnitde of for force let me give you a hint rate is a type of force right is a force do you to ear bll on an object and the direction waight is always downwards but what instrument is used to measure weight that's right it's a spring balance and let me show you a spring balance here and as you can see it is used to measure the rate of this ball the reading is to newton as we saw we can use a spring balance to measure the right of a body but now how can we use the spring balance to measure force let me show you let's say we place the ball like this connected to the spring balance what will be the reading of the spring balance here that's right it 's going to be zero because the entire right of the ball is acting on the table and the spring is not being pulled now let's say i want to measure the force with which i pull the ball but rather than pulling it from the strpring here i going to pull it using the spring balance so when i pull the ball like this the reading on the spring balance will give me the force with which i pulling the ball and you can try this your self take the spring balance and try to pull a heavy object like a chair with the spring balance then when you look at the reading on thespring balance why you re pulling the chair that's the value of the force so the spring balance will help you measure the force with which you pulling the chair as we discussed forces measured in the unit newton newton is the ssi unit of force now to understand the unit newton we need to look at the formula for force we know from our experience that a small force causes a small increase in speed but a large force causes a creater increasing speed this more acceleration here and this is exactly what newutton second law of motion states that the rate of change of linear momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and it takes pace in the direction of the force let's analyze newton second law and derite the formula for force now you know what is momentum momentum is mass into velocity so pe quence m into the fa p the symbo of momentum for this ball the momentum is going to be the mass ofthe ball multiplied by the velocity of the ball when we say linear momentum we mean the body is traveing in a straight line like here and change of linear momentum means final momentum minus the initial momentum final momentum will be m to v where these the final velocity and the initial momentum will be and into you where use the initial velocity so change of linear momentum is n v minus m you and what will be the rate of change of linear momentum that's right m v minus m you by team for rate we need to divide by time here tis the time and according to the second law it states that the full suppli on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of linear momentum of the body so f is directly proportional to m v minus same you by t n you take m common we have v minus you by t and what is v minus you by t that's right acceleration so f the force is directly proportional to mass into acceleration now if you want to change this directly proportional relation into an equation we need to use a constant of proportionality so we have f equal to ke into m me case the constant of proportionality here and based on the units the scientists set it to be one so the equation becomes f equal to m a the force on a body so the force applied on a body is the mass of the body into the acceleration of the body and that 's a formula for force f equal to and how can we define one newton based on the formula f equally to m a it 's really easy if you look at the formula f equal to m a so one newton is the force that needs to be applied on the body of mass one kg to give it an acceleration of one me of a second square so one newton equals one kg into one me ter a second squareor the unit newton is basically kg into meetter a second square now if i ask you how much force need to be applied on a body of mass three kg to give it an acceleration of two meter a second square that's right the forces equal to six newton you just have to use the formula f equal to mme and if you subsitute the values three kg and two meter a second square and just multiply them you get the forces six newton let's say force of twenty new ton is applied on a body of mass five kg what is the acceleration here that's right the acceleration is go to be four meter per second square we can use the formula f equal to m a now if we bring the acceleration a on the left hand side we get equal to force by mass and substituting the values the acceleration is four meter per second square as we discussed the si unit of forces newton and did you know that the cg' unit of forces dy as we saw one newutton equals one kg into one meter a second square and similarly in the cg system one dy equals one gram into one centimeter per second square so in cgs we use grams and centimeters now let me ask you one newutton is how many dying what is this unit conversion that's right one newton equals tend to the pa five dying so that's hundred thousand d or one lag d now how do we get this unit converssion so it's pretty simple you start with one newton equals one kg into one meter a second square now since we want to convert to the c' units we need to convert one kg to grams so that 's thousand grams and one meter per second squareis going to be hundred centimeterof a second square so if you multiply those numbers you are going to get ten to the path five tenend to the power five gram centimeter per second square that's basically tend to the power five dy hundred thousand time let's place the important formula force f equal to m a and the unit of force on our concept bo friends i hope the concept of force is crystal clear to now so now i don 't have to force you to try the quiz and the
