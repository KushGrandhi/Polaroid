## > **Description:**

**Adaptive Notes Generator** *is a tool that helps us attend online classes effectively:star_struck:. Due to the Online class culture, taking notes in pen and paper is not a good idea, the only options left are to click screenshots or struggle to note down everything in your notebook:unamused:. Our application will make your life easier, once a meeting video:film_projector: is provided, we will create the notes that will save you time:stopwatch: of research and gathering resources. We will divide your meeting into useful segments and add additional data to make it easy to understand any concept.:bookmark_tabs::bookmark_tabs:*

## > **Problem we are Solving:** 

*During the Pandemic, many meetings were moved to online platforms:computer:, and still, continue using it. The Transition from blackboard:white_square_button: to PowerPoint:desktop_computer: has come with some problems, some of them are as follows:* 

**1. Not being able to keep up the pace:hourglass_flowing_sand::hourglass_flowing_sand: due to concise information on each slide.**

**2. Not having the ability to write:black_nib::black_nib: effectively what the teacher explains.**

*We plan to address these issues through our project:innocent::wink:.*
